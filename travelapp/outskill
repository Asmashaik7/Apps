I listened to 2 days means actually 18 hours of agentic AI master mind sessions by Outskill.9 hours per day.
I just wanna try to make apps using the knowledge I gained from the one of the topics in the session, i.e Building apps using AI, claude.
Im also using ChatGpt and Gemini for help.
Just a try :)
